# Fronter Display
This is a fork of [`Draconizations/pk-personal-front`](https://github.com/Draconizations/pk-personal-front) tailored for our use and with some added functionalities.

## Usage
This project uses pnpm instead of yarn or npm. 

To run a dev server, use `pnpm dev`. To build the site, run `pnpm build`. 

### Deployment 
We've decided to run this site on Cloudflare Pages, but due to technical limitations we had to hardcode our system name. 
We will look at solving this issue soon.

## Psst. Give me money
This section has been left as-is from the upstream.
